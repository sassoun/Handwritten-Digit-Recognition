# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition with Tensorflow

* This project has built multiple types of neural networks (CNN and MLP) by using Tensorflow system.
* Convolutional Neural network gave the highest accuracy of 98.4% than any other neural networks.

* After the cnn.py file runs successfully, all the weights and bias text files will be updated with values which are used to built the Convolutional Neural Network. These values in text files represent our CNN model which automatically can be used in any other languages such as Verilog or VHDL.
